# Spatio-Temporal-Analysis
Analysis and Visualization of the AIS data by using Geopandas and Matplotlib, also clustering the ports based on AIS message density.

## Instruction to execute the Application:

*** Download the zip file in order to see the code and output, not visible in github because of the file size (> 25 MB) ***

1.	Extract the .zip file and Install the required packages.
	-	pip install -U Shapely -user
	-	pip install -U geopandas –user
	-	pip install -U numpy –user

	- pip install -U scikit-learn --user
  - pip install -U seaborn --user
	
2. Extract .zip file and keep all the files into one folder.
	
3. Run the file ‘SpatioTemporalAnalysis.py’ in google Colaboratory / Jupyter Notebook.
   If using Jupyter Notebook,
   (1) Install Anaconda
   (2) From Anaconda Command Line, Go to the folder where all the files are stored.
   (3) Next, Run Command "Jupyter Notebook"
   (4) Open SpatioTemporalAnalysis.ipynb (If want to see the animation, Run all the cells).
   
   If google Colaboratory(Recommeneded if you want to take a quick look),
